# Booksify

As part of my Corizo Internship, I did this login and registration pages to authenticate the users who enter the website and register new users details.
To do this, I used HTML,CSS as frontend and Javascript,Node JS, Express JS and MongoDB as backend.

It's my part of work in a team of 6 members. One member created the Databsae in MongoDB atlas and shared the connection string to the whole team.
